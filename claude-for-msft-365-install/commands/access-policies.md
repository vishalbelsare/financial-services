description: Build the access_policies value — the granular, IAM-shaped way to allow or deny add-in features
---

# Configure access_policies

`access_policies` is the add-in's access-control mechanism going forward: a JSON
list of allow/deny **statements** — IAM-shaped — that decide which
features are available and under what conditions. Where `disabled_features` is a
single flat list — a feature is on or off for everyone — `access_policies` gives
you the same off switch *plus* conditions and effects:

| Want | `disabled_features` | `access_policies` |
|---|---|---|
| Turn a feature off for everyone | ✔ `disabled_features='skills.authoring'` | ✔ a resource-less `deny` statement (same effect) |
| Turn a feature off only on certain documents | ✗ | ✔ add a `resource` (e.g. a sensitivity label) |
| Turn a feature off *except* for approved documents (allowlist) | ✗ | ✔ `"effect": "allow"` |
| Attribute the block in UI copy / telemetry | limited | ✔ per-statement `description` and source |

A statement with **no `resource`** is exactly `disabled_features` — so anything
you'd put there, you can put here. The `resource` is what adds granularity, and its
`type` is the extension point: today the resource is a document (`open_file`,
`uploaded_file`) identified by its **Microsoft Purview sensitivity label** or, for
the open document, by its **file path**; further resource types plug into the same
shape without a new config key. New deployments should start here;
`disabled_features` remains supported for the simple flat case.

Two document-conditioned controls ship today:

- **Whether the add-in runs at all on an open document** (the `addin.access` kill
  switch), keyed off the open document's label or its path.
- **Whether a file may be attached as an upload** (`file.upload`), keyed off the
  *attached* file's own label — Office files and PDFs.

Walk the admin through the four steps below, then hand the finished JSON to
[manifest](manifest.md#access_policies) as one more key.

## 1. Get the label GUIDs

Skip this step if every rule matches on a file path (step 2) rather than a label.

Statements match on the label's **GUID** (`mip_label_guid`) — stable across
renames and locales. Have the admin pull their taxonomy once with the Purview
compliance PowerShell module (no app registration needed; it uses Microsoft's
first-party sign-in):

```powershell
# One-time: Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName admin@theirtenant.com
Get-Label | Sort-Object Priority | Format-Table Priority, DisplayName, Name, Guid, ParentId
```

Ask them to paste the table. From it, note for each label they care about:
`Guid` (what you'll match), `DisplayName`, and `ParentId` (non-empty means it's
a *sublabel* — see the parent-label rule below).

If they can't run PowerShell, GUIDs are also visible in the Purview compliance
portal URL when a label is opened for editing, or via Microsoft Graph Explorer
(`GET /security/informationProtection/sensitivityLabels`).

## 2. Choose the statements

Ask which of these shapes they need — most tenants want the first, second, or
both. Then substitute their GUIDs.

**Block the add-in on documents with a given label** (the common ask —
"Claude must not run on our top-secret files"):

```json
{
  "effect": "deny",
  "action": "addin.access",
  "resource": {
    "type": "open_file",
    "identifiers": [{ "type": "mip_label_guid", "equals": "<guid>" }],
    "description": "Highly Confidential"
  }
}
```

**Block the add-in on documents in a given location** (for files that can't
carry a label, such as those on a network share — see the path rule below):

```json
{
  "effect": "deny",
  "action": "addin.access",
  "resource": {
    "type": "open_file",
    "identifiers": [{ "type": "file_path", "startsWith": "//fileserver/restricted/" }],
    "description": "Restricted share"
  }
}
```

**Refuse uploading files that carry a given label** ("users may not attach
restricted files"):

```json
{
  "effect": "deny",
  "action": "file.upload",
  "resource": {
    "type": "uploaded_file",
    "identifiers": [{ "type": "mip_label_guid", "equals": "<guid>" }],
    "description": "Confidential - Restricted"
  }
}
```

**Turn a feature off for everyone** (the `disabled_features` equivalent — no
`resource`, so it applies everywhere; here, no user may author skills):

```json
{ "effect": "deny", "action": "skills.authoring" }
```

**Allowlist — the add-in runs only on approved labels.** The first `allow`
written for an `(action, resource type)` flips that scope to default-deny:
only files matching an `allow`'s identifiers pass, and unlabeled files no
longer pass either. A matching `deny` still wins over a matching `allow`.

```json
{
  "effect": "allow",
  "action": "addin.access",
  "resource": {
    "type": "open_file",
    "identifiers": [
      { "type": "mip_label_guid", "equals": "<general-guid>" },
      { "type": "mip_label_guid", "equals": "<public-guid>" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Combine as needed — the value is one JSON array of statements. `action` also
accepts an array to apply one statement to several actions:

```json
[
  { "effect": "deny", "action": "addin.access", "resource": { ... } },
  { "effect": "deny", "action": ["file.upload", "skills.authoring"] }
]
```

### Statement grammar (reference)

```
statement   := { effect, action, resource? }
effect      := "allow" | "deny"
action      := <slug> | [ <slug>, ... ]          # feature slugs; unknown -> skipped + reported
resource    := { type, identifiers: [identifier, ...], description? }
type        := "open_file" | "uploaded_file"    # the extension point
identifier  := { type: "mip_label_guid" | "mip_label_name" | "file_path", <one operator> }
```

| `action` slug | Gates | Takes a `resource`? |
|---|---|---|
| `addin.access` | Whether the add-in runs at all on the open document — the kill switch | `open_file` |
| `file.upload` | Whether a file may be attached to the conversation | `uploaded_file` |
| `skills.authoring` | Creating, editing, and uploading skills; running admin-provisioned skills is unaffected | — |
| `thumbs` | Response feedback (thumbs up / down and the follow-up prompt) | — |

Unknown slugs are skipped and reported — forward-compatible. A resource-less
statement works with any slug; today only `addin.access` and `file.upload`
have a resource type to scope against.

| Operator | Value | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `equals` | string | GUID: case-insensitive. Name: exact, case-sensitive. Path: see the path rule |
| `startsWith` | string | prefix match — `mip_label_name` (see the parent-label rule) and `file_path` |
| `endsWith` | string | suffix match — `mip_label_name` only |
| `exists` | boolean | presence check — `false` = unlabeled, `true` = any label |

Exactly one operator per identifier; `mip_label_guid` supports only `equals` and
`exists`, `file_path` only `equals` and `startsWith`. A resource needs at least
one identifier — an empty `identifiers` array never matches. Statements OR together; identifiers within a resource OR
together; a matching `deny` beats a matching `allow`; the first
`allow` for an `(action, resource type)` flips that scope to default-deny.
`description` is inert prose (surfaced in UI copy / telemetry, never matched).

## 3. Rules to explain before they ship it

Tell the admin these six things before they ship; each is a common surprise.

**A statement does exactly what it says — nothing is implied.** Blocking the
add-in on a label (`addin.access` on `open_file`) does *not* also stop that
document from being uploaded into a *different* document, and vice versa. A
label blocked "in all its forms" is **two statements** — one on `open_file`,
one on `uploaded_file`. Statements, and the identifiers within each, OR
together.

**Parent labels have no GUID inside a file — only sublabels do.** A document
carries its sublabel's GUID (the row with a `ParentId`). To block a whole
parent group ("everything under *Confidential*"), either list each sublabel's
GUID, or match on the composed display name, which Office writes as
`"Parent - Sublabel"` (include the ` - ` separator in the prefix so a sibling
label like *Confidentiality Waiver* doesn't also match):

```json
{ "type": "mip_label_name", "startsWith": "Confidential - " }
```

**Name matching is exact and rename-hazardous.** `mip_label_name` compares the
label's display name character-for-character — case-sensitive, whitespace
included — as the labeling client wrote it, in that user's locale. `equals`,
`startsWith`, and `endsWith` are available. Prefer GUIDs; use names only for the
parent-group case above, and tell the admin a rename breaks the match.

**A label the add-in can't read fails closed.** When any statement targets
`uploaded_file`, an attachment whose label is unreadable — a Purview-*encrypted*
package, or legacy `.xls` / `.ppt` / `.doc` — is refused rather than let
through. If their sensitive labels apply encryption, that's the behavior they
want; if they must upload legacy formats, they'll need to convert them.

**"Only classified documents"** — to make the add-in refuse *unlabeled* files,
match on presence rather than a GUID:

```json
{ "type": "mip_label_guid", "exists": false }
```

On `uploaded_file` this also matches formats that can't carry a label at all
(images, CSV, plain text) — say so, so they aren't surprised when a screenshot
is refused.

**A path rule matches the path exactly as Office reports it.** `file_path`
compares against the open document's path or URL as the Office host spells it,
with three normalizations only: ASCII letters are case-folded, `\` and `/` are
the same separator in Windows paths (`"//fileserver/restricted/"` and
`"\\\\fileserver\\restricted\\"` are the same prefix — the forward-slash form
avoids JSON escaping), and a `file:` URL is read as the path it names. Beyond
that:

- End every prefix with a separator — `//fileserver/restricted` also matches
  `//fileserver/restricted-archive/`.
- Nothing resolves aliases. The same share reached through a mapped drive letter,
  a DFS namespace, or another server name is a different path — add each
  spelling as another identifier.
- SharePoint and OneDrive documents report a percent-encoded URL (`%20` for a
  space); write the prefix encoded the same way. Non-ASCII characters must match
  exactly.
- A document with no path — unsaved, or one Office can't report a path for —
  never matches a `deny`, and is refused under an `allow` list, like an
  unlabeled document.
- Only the open document is gated. Uploads have no path, so `file_path` never
  matches `uploaded_file`. A document saved to a new location is judged by the
  new path once the pane regains focus.
- Add-in versions released before `file_path` drop any statement that contains
  it, so the path rule does not apply on those versions. Keep `file_path`
  identifiers in their own statements so an older version still applies the
  label rules.

## 4. Validate and hand off

Read the finished array back to the admin as a table (effect / action /
resource / identifiers) before generating anything. Then pass it to
[manifest](manifest.md#access_policies) as the `access_policies` key. The build
script rejects a value that isn't valid JSON and warns on each statement that
doesn't fit the grammar above (bad `effect`, unknown resource / identifier type,
missing or duplicate operator, a `file_path` on `uploaded_file`). Fix every
warning now: the add-in reports unknown action slugs and an unparseable value, but a statement that fails the
grammar is dropped silently — this build-time check is the only catch, and the
admin would otherwise ship a rule that quietly never applies.

`access_policies` is manifest / bootstrap only — it does **not** fit in Entra
extension attributes (256-char cap). If they use per-user
[bootstrap](bootstrap.md), the same array goes there as a native JSON value
rather than a string.
